//! Custom emotes and stickers — image packs.
//!
//! An image pack is a set of named images. The name is a shortcode (`blobcat`),
//! written `:blobcat:` where a person types it, and each image says whether it's
//! usable as an inline emote, as a sticker, or both.
//!
//! A pack lives in a room, as an `m.room.image_pack` state event; a room may
//! hold any number of them, one per state key. `m.image_pack.rooms` in account
//! data is the list of packs you've chosen to carry with you everywhere rather
//! than using only in the room they came from. Between them that's the whole
//! model — there is no such thing as a pack that isn't in a room, which is why
//! [`create_personal_pack`] makes a room nobody else is in.
//!
//! Both events are also read and written under the names MSC2545 used before
//! Matrix 1.19 stabilised them (`im.ponies.room_emotes`, `im.ponies.emote_rooms`),
//! because that's what FluffyChat and Cinny still speak. The one thing with no
//! stable equivalent is `im.ponies.user_emotes`, the MSC's single personal pack
//! in account data: it's read so that a pack made in another client shows up
//! here, and written when it's edited, but nothing new is put in it.
//!
//! Everything is parsed leniently. These events are written by other clients
//! and edited by hand, so a pack with one malformed image should lose that
//! image, not the pack — and a malformed pack should lose the pack, not the
//! user's whole emote set. Fields we don't recognise are carried through an
//! edit rather than dropped.
