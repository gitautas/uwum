//! Who's online, and when they were last seen.
//!
//! Presence is an EDU, and EDUs only arrive over legacy `/sync` — sliding sync
//! has no presence extension in this SDK, and `SyncService` is the only sync
//! we run. So this polls `GET /_matrix/client/v3/presence/{user}/status`
//! instead, for the people the UI is actually drawing, and pushes what changed.
//!
//! The frontend declares who it cares about (`watch`), which is the set of
//! people on screen: the open room's member list, DM partners in the sidebar,
//! whoever's profile card is open. Polling every member of every joined room
//! would be hundreds of requests a minute for pixels nobody is looking at.
//!
//! Presence is also *optional*, and plenty of homeservers have it switched off
//! — Synapse ships with `presence.enabled: false` in a lot of deployments. A
//! server that says nothing gets no indicator at all rather than a wall of
//! grey "offline" dots, which would be a confident lie.
