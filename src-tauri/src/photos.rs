//! The photo library, on the platforms that have one.

//! A WebView can't enumerate photos — `<input type="file">` runs the system
//! picker out of process and returns only the chosen file. That's the right
//! privacy default, and it's why showing a grid of recent photos inside the app
//! needs native code. The iOS half lives in `gen/apple/Sources/uwum/main.mm`;
//! this is the Rust side of that bridge.
//!
//! Exports land in the temp directory as ordinary files, so the picked photo
//! rejoins the *existing* upload path — `send_attachment` with a path — rather
//! than needing a second one that carries bytes.

     * it on its own, long before the app's own object files exist, so any

     * `ffi::start_app` is reachable from `main`.
     *
     * So the bridge is registered rather than imported. `main` hands us three
     * function pointers before starting the app, and we keep them here. It also
     * means a build with no photo support isn't a link error — it's an empty
     * `OnceLock`, which the commands report as "unsupported".
