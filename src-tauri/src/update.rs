//! Which update path this particular build can take, and — for the builds that
//! can't update themselves — what the newest release actually is.
//!
//! Tauri's updater replaces an install in place, so it only works where there
//! *is* an install to replace: a `.app`, an AppImage, or an NSIS/MSI install
//! root. Everything else the release workflow produces — the `.deb`, the
//! `.apk`, the `.ipa` — is owned by something that isn't us (apt, the phone),
//! and overwriting it from inside the app would either fail or corrupt it.
//!
//! Rather than let the frontend guess from a user-agent string, that decision
//! is made here, once, and handed over as a [`Mode`]. The two arms then read
//! the *same* manifest: `check()` on the updater plugin and [`latest_release`]
//! below both fetch `latest.json`, so a build can never be told about a version
//! the release workflow hasn't finished publishing.
