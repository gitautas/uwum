/**
 * Telling a cut-out apart from a photo.
 *
 * A transparent PNG pasted into a room is nearly always meant as a sticker — a
 * character, a reaction, something cropped out of its background — and drawing
 * it on a card with a border puts back the very box it was cut out of. So an
 * image that's mostly see-through is shown frameless, the way a sticker is.
 *
 * Only the pixels can say. The format can't (a PNG screenshot is opaque), and
 * neither can an alpha channel (plenty of opaque PNGs carry one anyway). And
 * since an `<img>` from `uwum://` is cross-origin and would taint a canvas, the
 * bytes come over IPC — the same thumbnail the timeline shows, so it's a
 * cache hit rather than a second download.
