/**
 * The noise gate itself, running on the audio thread.
 *
 * An AudioWorklet rather than a timer on the main thread: a voice app spends
 * most of its life minimised, and a hidden WebView throttles timers to about
 * once a second — a gate that opens a second late cuts off the start of every
 * sentence. The audio thread isn't throttled.
 *
 * Plain JavaScript because it's loaded by URL into its own global scope, which
 * TypeScript's DOM lib doesn't describe; see `noiseGate.ts` for the side that
 * talks to it.
